## On Sandbox

We offer a sandbox installation that is free for everyone to try out hawkBit's [Management UI](/hawkbit/ui/),
[Management API](/hawkbit/apis/management_api/), and [Direct Device Integration API](/hawkbit/apis/ddi_api/): &nbsp;
**[<i class="fas fa-desktop">&nbsp;</i> https://hawkbit.eclipseprojects.io](https://hawkbit.eclipseprojects.io)**

{{% warning %}}
The sandbox is a shared installation that will be reset from time to time. Therefore, it is not allowed to upload
any personal data.
