# Examples and Extensions

Next to the hawkBit core hosted here the project maintains as well [examples](https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit-examples) and [extension](https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit-extensions) repositories.

# hawkBit sandbox

We offer a sandbox installation that is free for everyone to try out hawkBit. However, keep in mind that the sandbox database will be reset from time to time. It is also not possible to upload any artifacts into the sandbox. But you can use it to try out the Management UI, Management API and DDI API. Keep in mind as well that you are not permitted to store any kind of personal data in the sandbox.

In addition the following vendors offer free trial accounts for their hawkBit compatible products:

- [Bosch IoT Rollouts](https://developer.bosch-iot-suite.com/service/rollouts)
- [Kynetics Update Factory](https://www.kynetics.com/iot-platform-update-factory)

# Device Integration

hawkBit exposes HTTP/JSon based [Direct Device Integration (API) API](https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/apis/ddi_api/) that allow any update client to integrate quite easily.

The [Eclipse Hara subproject](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.hawkbit.hara) aims to provide a reference agent software implementation of the Eclipse hawkBit device API. At the moment the project provides the [hara-ddiclient](https://github.com/eclipse/hara-ddiclient) Kotlin library that facilitates and speeds up the development of DDI API clients running on the JVM. The library is expected to soon see its first release under the Eclipse umbrella, and has been successfully used in production for years under its previous guise.

Additionally, the hawkBit project has the long term goal to provide [Eclipse Hono](https://github.com/eclipse/hono) integration which will provide connectivity through various IoT protocols and as a result will allow a wide range of clients to connect to hawkBit.

There are clients outside of the Eclipse IoT eco system as well, e.g.:

- [SWupdate](https://github.com/sbabic/swupdate) which is a Linux Update agent with focus on a efficient and safe way to update embedded systems.
- [rauc-hawkbit-updater](https://github.com/rauc/rauc-hawkbit-updater) which is a hawkBit client for the [RAUC](https://github.com/rauc/rauc) update framework written in C/glib.
- [rauc-hawkbit](https://github.com/rauc/rauc-hawkbit) which is a python-based hawkBit client demo application and library for the [RAUC](https://github.com/rauc/rauc) update framework.
- [hawkbit-rs](https://github.com/collabora/hawkbit-rs) provides a couple of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) crates to help [implement](https://crates.io/crates/hawkbit) and [test](https://crates.io/crates/hawkbit_mock) hawkBit clients.

# Getting Started

We are providing a [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) based reference [Update Server](hawkbit-runtime/hawkbit-update-server) including embedded H2 DB for test and evaluation purposes.
Run with docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 hawkbit/hawkbit-update-server
```

Open the update server in your browser:

[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

See below for how to build and run the update server on your own. In addition we have a [guide](https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/guides/runhawkbit/) for setting up a complete landscape.

# hawkBit (Spring boot) starters

Next to the [Update Server](hawkbit-runtime/hawkbit-update-server) we are also providing a set of [Spring Boot Starters](hawkbit-starters) to quick start your own [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) based application.

# Clone, build and run hawkBit

## Build and start hawkBit [Update Server](hawkbit-runtime/hawkbit-update-server)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit.git
cd hawkbit
mvn clean install
java -jar ./hawkbit-runtime/hawkbit-update-server/target/hawkbit-update-server-#version#.jar
```

## Start hawkBit [Device Simulator](https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit-examples/tree/master/hawkbit-device-simulator) (optional)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit-examples.git
cd hawkbit-examples
mvn clean install
```

```bash
java -jar ./hawkbit-device-simulator/target/hawkbit-device-simulator-#version#.jar
```

## Generate getting started data with the [Management API example](https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit-examples/tree/master/hawkbit-example-mgmt-simulator) (optional)

```bash
java -jar ./hawkbit-example-mgmt-simulator/target/hawkbit-example-mgmt-simulator-#version#-exec.jar
```

# Status and API stability

hawkBit is currently in '0.X' semantic version. That is due to the need that there is still content in hawkBit that is in need for refactoring. That includes the maven module structure, Spring Boot Properties, Spring Boot auto configuration as well as internal Java APIs (e.g. the [repository API](https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit/issues/197) ).

However, the device facing [DDI API](https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit/tree/master/hawkbit-rest/hawkbit-ddi-api) is on major version 'v1' and will be kept stable.

Server facing and [DMF API](https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit/tree/master/hawkbit-dmf/hawkbit-dmf-api) are [Management API](https://github.com/eclipse/hawkbit/tree/master/hawkbit-rest/hawkbit-mgmt-api) are on v1 as well. However, we cannot fully guarantee the same stability during hawkBit's 0.X development but we will try as best we can.
